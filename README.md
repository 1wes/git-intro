# Introduction to Git version Control

**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for _version control_ and _collaboration_.  
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

We will have a look at some essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.  
You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
You’ll learn how to:  

1. Create and use a repository.  
2. Start and manage a new branch. 
3. Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.  
4. Open and merge a pull request.  

### 1. To create a new repository
- In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
- Name your repository `hello-world`.
- Write a short description.
- Select Initialize this repository with a README.  

### 2. Branching  
It is a way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.   
By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.

When you create a branch off the master branch, _you’re making a copy, or snapshot_, of master as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

### 3. Make and commit changes
- Click the `README.md` file.
- Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
- In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
- Write a commit message that describes your changes.
- Click `Commit` changes button.
