# Introduction to Git version Control

**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for _version control_ and _collaboration_.  
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

We will have a look at some essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.  
You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
You’ll learn how to:  

1. Create and use a repository.  
2. Start and manage a new branch. 
3. Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.  
4. Open and merge a pull request.  

### 1. To create a new repository
- In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
- Name your repository `hello-world`.
- Write a short description.
- Select Initialize this repository with a README.
